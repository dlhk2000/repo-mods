# C.A.R.T. R.E.C.L.A.I.M.
**Reclamation Engine for C.A.R.T. Loss And Immediate Materialization**

## Overview

This *R.E.P.O.* mod enables automatic respawning of your C.A.R.T. in the tragic-yet-suspiciously-frequent event of destruction, annihilation, or "accidental deployment into a bottomless pit."

Whether your teamâ€™s logistics expert got a little too enthusiastic with their driving, or you simply forgot the C.A.R.T. was not, in fact, waterproof, **R.E.C.L.A.I.M.** has your back.

Gone? Respawned.  
Lost? Reinstated.  
Exploded? â€¦Still respawned.  

A shiny new C.A.R.T. will be waiting for you at the truck â€” as if nothing ever happened. We promise we won't tell the taxman.

## Features

- ðŸšš Automatically respawns the C.A.R.T. at the truck after it's destroyed
- ðŸ”’ No buttons to press â€” it just worksâ„¢
- ðŸ’€ Supports even the most creative forms of C.A.R.T. annihilation

## Installation

If you're running this in multiplayer, only the host needs to install this mod.

1. Install **BepInEx** if you haven't already (https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/)
2. Download and extract the mod files into your `REPO` game folder. (e.g. "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\REPO\")
3. That's it! 

## Disclaimer

R.E.C.L.A.I.M. is not responsible for C.A.R.T. respawns that appear sideways, clipped into walls, or with a mild existential crisis. Use responsibly. Or donâ€™t. Weâ€™ll respawn it anyway.
